### A React JS application to book movie tickets
This is a React JS application that fetches data from an external API and displays a list of shows with their respective details on one screen. Clicking on a particular show will redirect the user to another screen that shows the summary of that particular show. The second screen also contains a button to book a movie ticket, which opens a form with the movie name already present and a few relevant details.

The app uses local storage to store user details, so that when the user submits the booking form, their details are stored locally and a reload does not occur.

The app uses a basic HTML and CSS styling that looks good and is responsive.
